[Here](http://sheltered-garden-02443.herokuapp.com/) is the link to the app, deployed with Heroku. If you can it's better that you clone the repo and run it locally.

# Installation

This project had been tested with python 3.6, so it's recommended to have an environment with this version of python to make it work.

As this package has `setup.py` aligned with `requirements.txt`, you only need to clone this repository and execute `pip install .` in the root of the project.

It's suggested to have an isolated environment activated before doing pip install (conda, venv, pipenv...).

# How To Run?

Once you have installed all of the requirements, you run the app with the command `streamlit run app.py` and automatically **streamlit** will open your navigator (localhost, port 8501 by default) and the app is ready, you can play with it!

Note: This is an experiment, if you encounter with any issue, please let me know about it.
You can try also `streamlit run deathtoll.py`, focused on death trends, as confirmed "cases" depend a lot on the number of tests performed per country.
